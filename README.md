# DSC @ LLNL 2024

This was my portion of the code contributed to my team for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Data Science Challenge 2024. For this challenge, my team and I deployed and constructed several models, including random forest, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, and various types of neural networks. We attempted to use these models to analyze and classify heartbeats based on ECG data. The data was drawn from Kaggle for the first part, and LLNL researchers for the following part. Using this data, we detected heart arrhythmias, determined the causes of these irregularities, predicted activation times in different areas of the heart, and generated full depictions of activation maps. I would like to thank my teammates and the LLNL staff for their help with completing this project.
